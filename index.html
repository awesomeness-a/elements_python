                <header>Why Python?</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Python is a <em>general-purpose</em> programming language that can be used to build almost any kind of program that does not need direct access to the computer's hardware.</p>
                    <div id="benefits">
                        <h4>It's relatively easy to learn</h4>
                        <p>Especially when compared to other widely used programming languages, the core Python language is remarkably easy to learn.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div id="benefits">
                        <h4>It's relatively easy to use</h4>
                        <p>Because it eliminates much of the complexity in other tools, Python programs are simpler, smaller, and more flexible than equivalent programs in other popular languages.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div id="benefits">
                        <h4>It's mixable</h4>
                        <p>Python is good at rapid prototypingâ€”systems may be implemented in Python first, to leverage its speed of development, and later moved to other programming languages like C++ for delivery, one piece at a time, according to performance demands.</p>
                    </div>
                    
                    <div id="benefits">
                        <h4>It's powerful</h4>
                        <p>Its toolset places it between traditional scripting languages (such as Tcl, Scheme, and Perl) and systems development languages (such as C, C++, and Java). Python provides all the simplicity and ease of use of a scripting language, along with more advanced software-engineering tools typically found in compiled languages.</p>
                    </div>
                   
                    <p><strong>In addition</strong> to the above, Python <em>is really fun</em> to do programming with, and I hope you'll love it as much as I do!</p>
                    <p id="note">To be able to follow the content of this website, you need to have Python 3+ installed on your computer. You can go through <a href="https://python.swaroopch.com/installation.html" id="resources-link">this article</a> on how to do that. Also, you need to have a text editor for working with your Python files (try VS Code, it's great and available <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" id="resources-link">here</a> for free). </p>

            <section class="main-section" id="program">
                <header>What is a program?</header>
                <article>
                    <p>A <strong>program</strong> is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.</p>
                    <p>Basic instructions include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>input</strong>: get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device;</li>
                        <li><strong>output</strong>: display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device;</li>
                        <li><strong>math</strong>: perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication;</li>
                        <li><strong>conditional execution</strong>: check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code;</li>
                        <li><strong>repetition</strong>: perform some action repeatedly and execute the appropriate code.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Essentially, a program is a <em>sequence of definitions and commands</em>. Definitions are evaluated and commands are executed by Python interpreter in a shell.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>Python interpreter</strong> is a program that reads and executes Python code. To start Python interpreter, type in a shell</p>
                    <code>python3</code>
                    <p>This command starts a Python interpreter where you can write Python expressions.
                    <p>Traditionally, the first program you write is called <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong><br>It's simple and all it does is display the words "Hello, World!" In Python, it looks like this:</p>
                    <code><span id="comment"># my first Python program</span>
                        print('Hello, World!')</code>
                    <p>This is an example of a <strong>print statement</strong> which simply displays a value on the screen.</p>
                    <p>Statements instruct interpreter to do something. They can be typed directly in a shell or stored in a file that is read into the shell and evaluated.</p>
                    <p># symbol indicates that any text to the right is a comment and should be ignored by the interpreter. Comments are useful as notes for the reader of the program.</p>
                    <p>Congratulations, you just wrote you first Python program! How awesome is that?</p>
                    <p id="note">If you're interested in learning about shell scripting (you should be), there's a number of good resources.

            <!--------------------Variables and Expressions--------------->
            <section class="main-section" id="var-expressions">
                <article>
                    <header>Variables and Expressions</header>
                    <p>One of the most powerful features of a programming language is the ability to manipulate variables. A <strong>variable</strong> is a name that refers to a value. A value is one of the basic things a program works with, like a letter "a" or a number 42.</p>
                    <p><em>An assignment statement</em> creates a new variable and gives it a value.</p>
                    <code>band_name = 'Black Sabbath'
                      num = 42
                      pi = 3.141592653589793
                    </code>
                    <p>To retrieve a value associated with a variable, you simply type its name.</p>
                    <code>pi
                    >>> 3.141592653589793
                    </code>
                    <p>The first example assigns a string to a new variable named <span class="text-inline-code">band_name</span>; the second gives the integer 42 to <span class="text-inline-code">num</span>; the third assigns the approximate value of Ï€ to <span class="text-inline-code">pi</span>.</p>
                    <p>Some of the <strong>rules to follow</strong> when naming your variables:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Try to give meaningful names to your variables, so that when you're back to your own code, you can understand what it is about.</li>
                        <li>Variables can contain letters and numbers, but they can't begin with a number.</li> 
                        <li>In Python, we use only lowercase for variables names.</li>
                        <li>The underscore character _ can appear in a name for better code readability.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Also, Python has <strong>keywords</strong> that can't be used as variable names. If you try to use them as variable names, you will get a syntax error.</p>
                    <code>>>> class = 'Advanced Theoretical Zymurgy'
                    SyntaxError: invalid syntax
                    </code>
                    <h4>Expressions and Statements</h4>
                    <p>An <strong>expression</strong> is a combination of values, variables, and operators.</p>
                    <p>A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable. These are all valid expressions:</p>
                    <code>42
                    n 
                    n + 42
                    </code>
                    <p>A <strong>statement</strong> is a unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. We have already seen two kinds of statements: print and assignment.</p>
                    <p>The important difference between a statement and an expression is that <em>an expression has a value and a statement does not.</em></p>

            <!------------------Data Types and Operators------------------>
            <section class="main-section" id="data-types">
                <header>Data Types and Operators</header>
                <article>
                    <p>Programs manipulate data objects.<em> Everything is an object in a Python script.</em> Objects have a type that defines the kind of things programs can do with them.</p> 
                    <p>To check the type of an object, use function <span class="text-inline-code">type()</span></p>
                    <code>>>> num = 42
                        >>> type(num)
                    &lt;class 'int'&gt;
                    </code>
                    <p>In Python, data takes the form of objectsâ€”either built-in objects that Python provides, or objects we create using Python classes (we'll talk about that later).</p>
                    <p>Python provides powerful object types as an istrinsic part of the language.</p>

                    <h4>Operators and Operands</h4>
                    <p><strong>Operators</strong> are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication. The values the operator is applied to are called <strong>operands</strong>.</p>
                    <p>In the example above, <span class="inline-code">42</span> and <span id class="inline-code">42</span> are operands and the sign <span class="inline-code">+</span> is an operator. Here's a quick overview of the available operators.</p>

                    <p>It's common to run a math operation on a variable and then assign the result of the operation back to the variable, hence there is a shortcut for such expressions:</p>
                    <code>a = 2
                        a = a * 3
                    </code>
                    <p>can be written as</p>
                    <code>a = 2
                        a *= 3
                    </code>
                    <!-------------Order of Operations--------------->
                    <h4>Order of Operations</h4>
                    <p>When more than one operator appears in an expression, the order of evaluation depends on the rules of precedence. For mathematical operators, Python follows mathematical convention. The acronym PEMDAS is a useful way to remember the rules:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>P</strong>arentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to evaluate in the order you want.</li>
                        <li><strong>E</strong>xponentiation has the next highest precedence.</li>
                        <li><strong>M</strong>ultiplication and <strong>D</strong>ivision have the same precedence, which is higher than <strong>A</strong>ddition and <strong>S</strong>ubtraction, which also have the same precedence.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation).</p>
                    <p>To make the expressions more readable, it's better to use parentheses:<br><span class="inline-code">2 + (3 * 4)</span> is easier to read than <span class="inline-code"> 2 + 3 * 4.</span></p>
                    <!-------------------Strings------------------------>
                    <h4>Strings</h4>
                    <p>A string is an <em>ordered</em> sequence of case-sensitive characters. Strings are basically just a bunch of words.</p>
                    <p>You can specify strings using single quotes</p>
                    <code><span id="comment"># A single-quoted string assigned to a variable named pb</span>
                        pb = 'Peanut butter is the glue that holds my life together.'</code>
                    <p>or double quotes</p>
                    <code><span id="comment"># A double-quoted string assigned to a variable hold_on</span>
                    hold_on = "Hold on, let me overthink this."</code>
                    <p>To specify a multi-line string, use triple quotes (either single or double)</p>
                    <code><span id="comment"># A multi-line string assigned to a variable three_lines</span>
                    three_lines = '''This is the first line of a multi-line string.
                    This is the second line.
                    And finally, the third.
                    '''
                    </code>
                    <p>Triple-quoted strings are usually used for <strong>docstrings</strong>. Docstrings are taken as comments when they appear at specific points in your file.</p>
                    <p>Strings are <strong>immutable objects</strong>. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. It means you can't change its value in place; instead, you must run code to make a new object containing the new value.</p>
                    <p>Every object in Python is classified as either immutable or not. In terms of the core types, <em>numbers</em>, <em>strings</em>, and <em>tuples</em> are immutable; <em>lists</em>, <em>dictionaries</em>, and <em>sets</em> are notâ€”they can be changed in place freely, as can most objects you'll code with classes.</p>
                    <p>Sometimes we want to construct strings from other information. This is where the <span class="inline-code">format()</span> method is useful.</p>
                    <code>year = 1936
                        name = 'Alan Turing'
                        print('In {0}, {1} published one of the most influential math papers in history, in which he introduced the idea of a "Universal Machine."'.format(year, name))
                    </code>
                    <p>Output:</p>
                    <code>In 1936, Alan Turing published one of the most influential math papers in history, in which he introduced the idea of a "Universal Machine."</code>
                    <p><span class="inline-code">{0}</span> corresponds to the variable <span class="inline-code">year</span> which is the first argument to the format method, and <span class="inline-code">{1}</span> corresponds to the variable <span class="inline-code"> name</span> which is the second argument.</p>
                    <p>Note that Python starts counting from 0 which means that first position is at index 0, second position is at index 1, and so on.</p>
                    <p>We can achieve the same result using string concatenation.</p>
                    <code>'In ' + str(year) + ', ' + name + ' published one of the most influential math papers in history, in which he introduced the idea of a "Universal Machine."'</code>
                    <p>We can also name the parameters to the format method instead of indexing them:</p>
                    <code>print('In {year}, {name} published one of the most influential math papers in history, in which he introduced the idea of a "Universal Machine."'.format(year, name))</code>
                    <p>There is a shorter way to do named parameters, called <strong>"f-strings"</strong>, which is a more elegant and readable way to format a string:</p>
                    <code>print(f'In {year}, {name} published one of the most influential math papers in history, in which he introduced the idea of a "Universal Machine."')
                    </code>
                    <p><strong>Escape characters</strong></p>
                    <p>Let's say you have a quote within your string. If you try to type ' character within your single-quoted string, Python will get confused and give you <span class="inline-code">SyntaxError</span>.</p>
                    <p>To prevent this from happening, you need to use an <strong>escape character</strong>. Escape characters invoke an alternative interpretation on the following characters in a character sequence. In this particular case, we use a backslash character:</p>
                    <code>print('How\'s life?')</code>
                    <p>Another way to avoid <span class="inline-code">SyntaxError</span> is by using double quotes instead of single quotes.</p>
                    <code>print("How's life?")</code>
                    <p>There are a few more escape characters you should know, so go ahead, google about them.</p>
                    <p>We can check string's length with a built-in <span class="inline-code">len</span> function</p>
                    <code>>>> name = 'Angela'
                        >>> len(name)
                        6
                    </code>
                    <p>To fetch string's components, use indexing expressions</p>
                    <code>>>> name[0]
                        'A'
                    </code>
                    <p>In addition to simple positional indexing, sequences also support <strong>slicing</strong>, which is a nice way to extract a slice in a single step.</p>
                    <code>>>> city = 'London'
                        >>> city[2:4]
                        'nd'
                    </code>
                    <p>The general form of slicing, x[i : j] means "give me everything in x starting from i and up to but not including j."</p>
                    <p>Some common usage variations:</p>

                <h4>Lists</h4>
                <p>Lists are <em>ordered</em> collections of arbitrary objects. They can contain any sort of objects and can be changed in placeâ€”they are <em>mutable</em> objects, and can respond to all the sequence operations used with strings, such as indexing, slicing, and concatenation.</p>
                <p>We create a list using square brackets.</p>
                <code>new_list = [1, 'apple', 42, 'answer', ['nested', 'list', 'of', 'strings']]
                empty_list = []
                </code>
                <p>We access list's items by position using the bracket operator. Remember that the indices start at 0</p>
                <code>>>> new_list[0]
                    1
                </code>
                <p>Because they are sequences, lists support many of the same operations as strings. But, unlike strings, lists are mutable.</p>

                <!--------------Dictionaries--------------->
                <h4>Dictionaries</h4>
                <p>Dictionaries are <em>unordered</em> collections of <span class="inline-code">key:value</span> pairs. 
                <ul>
                    <li>They are of the category "mutable mapping."</li>
                    <li>They are <em>objects that map keys to values.</em></li>
                    <li>Dictionaries can contain objects of any type, and they support nesting to any depth.</li>
                    <li>Keys can be any immutable objects.</li>
                    <li>Sequence operations don't work with dictionaries, because dictionaries are mappings and have no notion of ordering among their items.</li>
                </ul>  
                </p>
                <p>We can create a dictionary using several ways.</p>
                <code><span id="comment"># Using curly brackets</span>
                >>> fruits = {'apples': 3.40, 'bananas': 2.45, 'oranges': 4.0, 'pineapples': 10.5}
                >>> fruits
                {'apples': 3.40, 'bananas': 2.45, 'oranges': 4.0, 'pineapples': 10.5}
                </code>
                <code><span id="comment"># Using dict()</span>
                >>> fruits = dict(apples = 3.40, bananas = 2.45, oranges = 4.0, pineapples = 10.5)
                >>> fruits
                {'apples': 3.40, 'bananas': 2.45, 'oranges': 4.0, 'pineapples': 10.5}
                </code>
                <code><span id="comment"># Using lists and zip()</span>
                >>> fruits = ['apples', 'bananas', 'oranges', 'pineapples']
                >>> prices = [3.40, 2.45, 4.0, 10.5]
                >>> groceries = dict(zip(fruits, prices))
                >>> groceries
                {'apples': 3.40, 'bananas': 2.45, 'oranges': 4.0, 'pineapples': 10.5}
                </code>
                <p>In dictionaries, items are stored and fetched by key, instead of positional offset. To fetch a value, you supply the key with which it is associated, not its relative position.</p>
                <code>>>> groceries = {'apples': 3.40, 'bananas': 2.45, 'oranges': 4.0, 'pineapples': 10.5}
                    >>> groceries['apples']
                    3.40
                </code>
                <p><span class="inline-code">in</span> allows you to test for key existence, and the <span class="inline-code">.keys()</span> method returns all the keys in the dictionary.</p>
                <code>>>> 'peaches' in groceries
                    False
                </code>
                <code>>>> list(groceries.keys())
                ['oranges', 'apples', 'bananas', 'pineapples']</code>
                <p>Dictionaries are <em>mutable</em>, so you can change, expand, and shrink them in place without making new dictionaries: simply assign a value to a key to change or create an entry.</p>
                <code>>>> groceries['peaches'] = 6.30
                    >>> groceries
                    {'apples': 3.40, 'peaches': 6.30, 'bananas': 2.45, 'oranges': 4.0, 'pineapples': 10.5}
                </code>
                <p>Other common dictionary methods:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="inline-code">.items()</span> returns (key, value) pair tuples</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-code">.values()</span> returns all the dictionary's values.</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-code">.get()</span> returns <span class="inline-code">None</span> if key doesn't exist in a dictionary</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-code">.pop()</span> deletes a key from a dictionary and returns the value it had.</li>
                    <li><span class="inline-code">.update()</span> merges the keys and values of one dictionary into another, overwriting values of the same key if there's a clash</li>
                </ul>
                <code>>>> ingredients = {'eggs': 3, 'spam': 2, 'ham': 1}
                    >>> extra = {'toast': 4, 'muffin': 5}
                    >>> ingredients.update(extra)
                    >>> ingredients
                    {'muffin': 5, 'eggs': 3, 'toast': 4, 'spam': 2, 'ham': 1}
                </code>
                <p>Dictionaries can also be created with dictionary comprehensions.</p>
                <code>>>> d = {k: v for (k, v) in zip(['a', 'b', 'c'], [1, 2, 3])}
                    >>> d 
                    {'b': 2, 'c': 3, 'a': 1}
                </code>
                <h4>Tuples</h4>
                <p>Tuples work exactly like lists, except that they can't be changed in place (they are immutable) and are usually written as a series of items in paretheses, not square brackets.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>They are ordered collections of arbitrary objects.</li>
                    <li>They are accessed by offset.</li>
                    <li>They are immutable sequences.</li>
                    <li>You cannot change the size of a tuple without making a copy.</li>
                    <li>Tuples store access points to other objects (references), and indexing a tuple is relatively quick.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A tuple is written as a series of objects, separated by commas and normally enclosed in parentheses.</p>
                <code>>>> prices = (45, 32, 4, 98, 76)
                    >>> empty_tuple = ()
                    >>> single_item_tuple = (42,)
                </code>
                <code><span id="comment"># Tuples concatenation</span>
                    >>> (1, 2) + (3, 4)
                   (1, 2, 3, 4)
                </code>
                <p>The immutability of tuples provides some integrityâ€”you can be sure a tuple won't be changed through another reference elsewhere in a program.</p>
                <p>Also, tuples can be used in places where lists cannotâ€”for example, as dictionary keys.</p>
                <h4>Sets</h4>
                <p>A set is an <em>unordered</em> collection of unique and <em>immutable</em> objects that supports operations corresponding to mathematical set theory.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>An item appears only once in a set, no matter how many times it is added.</li>
                    <li>Sets are iterable, can grow and shrink on demand.</li>
                    <li>They may contain a variety of object types</li>
                    <li>Because they are unordered and do not map keys to values, sets are neither sequence nor mapping types.</li>
                    <li>Sets can contain only immutable object types. Lists and dictionaries cannot be embedded in sets, but tuples can if you need to store compound values.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We can create a set using the following:</p>
                <code>>>> set([41, 24, 43, 42])
                    {41, 24, 43, 42}</code>
                <code>>>> {41, 24, 43, 42}
                    {41, 24, 43, 42}</code>
                <code>>>> set('apple')
                    {'a', 'e', 'l', 'p'}
                </code>
                <p>Sets support operations corresponding to mathematical set theory.</p>
                <code><span id="comment"># Intersection</span>
                    >>> num = {7, 8, 9}
                    >>> num & {7, 10, 9}
                    {7, 9}
                </code>
                <code><span id="comment"># Union</span>
                    >>> {1, 5, 3, 6} | num
                    {1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
                </code>
                <code><span id="comment"># Difference</span>
                    >>> num - {8, 9}
                    {7}
                </code>
                <code><span id="comment"># Superset</span>
                    >>> num > {7, 8}
                    True
                </code>
                <p>Because items are stored only once in a set, sets can be used to <em>filter duplicates</em> out of other collections, though items may be reordered in the process because sets are unordered in general. Simply convert the collection to a set, and then convert it back again.</p>
                <code>>>> num = [61, 24, 43, 88, 24, 88, 100]
                    >>> set(num)
                    {24, 43, 61, 88, 100}
                    >>> num = list(set(num))
                    >>> num
                    [100, 43, 24, 88, 61]
                </code>
                <p>Sets can be used to isolate differences in lists, strings, and other iterable objects.</p>
                <code>>>> set([12, 21, 73, 50, 7]) - set([1, 12, 4, 50, 6])
                    {7, 21, 73}
                </code>
                <p>Sets are convenient when you're dealing with large data setsâ€”the intersection of two sets contains objects common to both categories, and the union contains all items in either set.</p>
                <code>>>> bands = {'black sabbath', 'ac/dc', 'thin lizzy', 'jimmy hendrix'}

                    True

                <h4>Files</h4>
                <p>File objects are considered a core type because they are created by a built-in function, but theyâ€™re not numbers, sequences, or mappings, and they donâ€™t respond to expression operators; they export only methods for common file-processing tasks.</p>
                <p>The built-in <span class="inline-code">open()</span> function creates a Python file object, which serves as a link to a file residing on your machine.</p>
                <code><span id="comment"># 'w' means open a file in a write mode</span>
                    >>> customers = open(r'C:\customers', 'w')</code>
                    <p>If the file already exists, opening it in write mode clears out the old data and starts fresh. If the file doesn't exist, a new one is created.</p>
                    <p>Once you make a file object with <span class="inline-code">open()</span>, you can call its methods to read from or write to the associated external file.</p>
                    <p>File text takes the form of strings in Python programs; reading a file returns its content in strings, and content is passed to the write methods as strings.</p>

                    <p>When coded this way, the temporary file object created by <span class="inline-code">open</span> will automatically read and return one line on each loop iteration.</p>
                    <p><strong>pickle</strong></p>
                    <p>The <span class="inline-code">pickle</span> module is an advanced tool that allows us to store almost any Python object in a file firectory, with no to- or from-string conversion requirement on our part. It's like a super-general data formatting and parsing utility. To store a dictionary in a file, we pickle it directly:</p>
                    <code>>>> d = {'apples': 42, 'bananas': 43, 'carrots': 44}
                        >>> f = open('datafile.pkl', 'wb')
                        >>> import pickle
                        >>> pickle.dump(d, f) <span id="comment"># Pickle an object to file</span>
                        >>> f.close()
                    </code>
                    <p>Then, to get the dictionary back later, we simple use <span class="inline-code">pickle</span> again to re-create it:</p>
                    <code>>>> f = open('datafile.pkl', 'rb')
                        >>> e = pickle.load(f) <span id="comment"># Load an object from file</span>
                        >>> e
                        {'apples': 42, 'bananas': 43, 'carrots': 44}
                    </code>
                    <p>We get back an equivalent dictionary object, with no manual splitting or converting required. The <span class="inline-code">pickle</span> module performs what is known as <em>object serialization</em>â€”converting objects to and from strings of bytesâ€”but requires very little work on our part.</p>
                    <p>Pickle internally translates our dictionary to a string form. Because <span class="inline-code">pickle</span> can reconstruct the object from this format, we don't have to deal with it ourselves.</p>
                    <p><strong>Storing Python Objects in JSON Format</strong></p>
                    <p><strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, as well as for machines to parse and generate.</p>
                    <p>JSON is built on two structures:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>a collection of name/value pairs</li>
                        <li>an ordered list of values</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to many languages which makes JSON an ideal data-interchange language.</p>
                    <p>JSON is so close to Python dictionaries and lists in syntax that translation to and from Python objects is trivial, and is automated by the <span class="inline-code">json</span> standard library module.</p>
                    <p>A Python dictionary with nested structures is very similar to JSON data, though Python's variables and experessions support richer structuring options:</p>
                    <code>>>> name = dict(first='Bob', last='Smith')
                        >>> person = dict(name=name, job=['dev', 'po'], age=35)
                        >>> person
                        {'job': ['dev', 'po'], 'name': {'last': 'Doe', 'first': 'John'}, 'age': 35}
                    </code>
                    <p></p>
                    <code>>>> import json
                        >>> json.dumps(person)
                        '{'job': ['dev', 'po'], 'name': {'last': 'Doe', 'first': 'John'}, 'age': 35}'
                    </code>
                    <code>>>> s = json.dumps(person)
                        >>> s
                        '{'job': ['dev', 'po'], 'name': {'last': 'Doe', 'first': 'John'}, 'age': 35}'
                    </code>
                    <code>>>> p = json.loads(s)
                        >>> p
                        {'job': ['dev', 'po'], 'name': {'last': 'Doe', 'first': 'John'}, 'age': 35}
                        >>> p == person
                        True
                    </code>
                    <p>It's straightforward to translate Python objects to and from JSON data strings in files. Prior to being stored in a file, your data is simply Python objects; the JSON module recreates them from the JSON textual representation when it loads it from the file:</p>
                    <code>>>> json.dump(person, fp=open('testjson.txt', 'w'), indent=4
                        >>> print(open('testjson.txt').read())
                        {
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"job": [
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"dev",
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"po"],
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"name": {
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"last": "Doe",
                                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"first": "John"
                            },
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"age": 35
                        }
                        >>> p = json.load(open('testjson.txt'))
                        >>> p
                        {'job': ['dev', 'po'], 'name': {'last': 'Doe', 'first': 'John'}, 'age': 35}
                    </code>
                    <p>Once you've translated from JSON text, you process the data using normal Python object operations in your script.</p>
                    <p>Note that strings are all Unicode in JSON to support text drawn from international character sets.</p>

                </code>
                <p>Exceptions raised by any statement in body of <span class="inline-code">try</span> are handled by the <span class="inline-code">except</span> statement and execution continues with the body of the <span class="inline-code">except</span> statement.</p>
                <p>To handle specific exceptions:</p>
                <code>try:

                    <p>Mode is optional and should be <span class="inline-code">'r'</span>if we're planning to read the file and <span class="inline-code">'w'</span> if we're going to write to the file.</p>
                    <p>A file handle open for read can be treated as a sequence of strings where each line in the file in]s a string in the sequence. </p>
